# Omnistack 11 - Be a Hero

Another Rocketseat project, based on them courses called Omnistack. The developed app consists in a system for raising donations for non governmental organizations. It's a way to start, like a North, with JavaScript full stack development. Enjoy!

I'm trying to use the branch system for development, to organize everything and also show that I can do it. Ihhhaw!!
