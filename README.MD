# Omnistack 11 - Be a Hero

Another Rocketseat project, based on them courses called Omnistack. The developed app consists in a system for raising donations for non governmental organizations. It's a way to start, like a North, with JavaScript full stack development. Enjoy!

I'm trying to use the branch system for development, to organize everything and also show that I can do it. Ihhhaw!!

## Backend
This REST API is built with Node.JS & Express, a mature technology, based on the V8 engine, from Google Chrome and a micro framework, basically for routing. The usage of nodemon is also important to be mentioned. This technology observes the updating in the code, and restart the app server, kind of a "app.reListen(PORT)".

The purposed database was built in sqlite3 and Knex, but I'd prefer work with PostgreSQL and sequelize. It maybe take a little more of my time, but I consider it better and more practical. I've configured a enviromnment based on a docker container and PgAdmin, for visualization. It works good! And it's so much better than intalling drivers in your local machine.

## Frontend
The frontend is based on React and its amazing feature, the JSX. The JSX make this SPA capable of using Javascript code and HTML & CSS markup and styling, together, making the development easier and faster. This is my favourite part, where the colors meet the data, where you got to communicate to be efficient, and again... Enjoy!

## Mobile
Developed with Expo. It's my first time using this technology. It looks like be good, because it have saved me from intalling and confuguring Android SDK, which kind of hurts me (haha funny joke). The idea is to use React Native to reuse a lot of stuff brought from web development, to become the work simpler and faster.
